	<p class="lead">I like food, it is yummy. I am privileged and sometimes I have food left over or can add an extra item to my shopping trolley without any qualms.</p>
	<p>Can that food go to local people who need it, where and when can I donate the food? I know a few local charities, but if I'm away from home where do I give the food, and what if local details change? I wanted to solve this by creating a UK-wide or international map, and I wanted different organisations to be able to use their own systems to keep the shared map updated. Finally in March 2015 I made a start to this and created Edible Giving, we shall see where it goes.</p>
