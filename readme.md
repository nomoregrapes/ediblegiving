## Edible Giving
The online website lives at [EdibleGiving.org](http://www.ediblegiving.org), go there to see it in action. Edible Giving can be used to find where you can give food to organisations that need it. Left over buffet food, or non-perishable unopened items, there are places where it can go! Or perhaps you want to give your time to one of these organisations or find out where and how they can help you.

## History & Credit
Edible Giving was created by [Gregory Marler](https://twitter.com/gregorymarler) of [No More Grapes](http://www.nomoregrapes.com) to fill a lack of help and support those organisations meeting needs in our local communities. 

Originally the website was a proof-of-interest website built in March 2015 following Open Data Camp. Gregory was able to extend functionality and build a more self-sustaining website that launched October 2015. The pre-launch development was possible thanks to a private donation. Continual hosting costs are met by No More Grapes.

## Website Data
The website creates and manages data of locations for organisations. If you wish to add data and want access to the system, then get in touch. Currently this is a semi-manual process, so that we can encourage organisations to join and curate the data themselves.

It is intended that the data will soon be very open and ready for you to use the data in your own websites/systems. The format is likely to be geojson, perhaps with the occasional csv dump. If this interests you, contact Edible Giving so data outputs can be built and maintained in a way that suits you.

## Website Code
The bulk of the website is programmed in PHP, using the Laravel Framework. A lot of the frontend, especially the maps, are programmed in Javascript and use the Mapbox JS library along with JQuery.

Currently programming is a one-man team and not expecting any other contributions. Pull requests will be considered, but it would be better to talk to the team about what you intend to do first. I maintain a private to-do list, and I don't always push my changes to Github right away. I might try using Github issue tracking for some things, yu could add issues or requests there if you really want.
